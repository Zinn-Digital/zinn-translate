 * and `scripts/wp-promo-check.py` fails the build if a checked-in copy has drifted from a
 * fresh render (§2.32 — generated code is an output).
 *
 * ⭐ Generated rather than shared because the alternative does not work. A single file
 * `require`d from seven plugins cannot carry seven text domains, and a **variable** text
 * domain is refused by the WordPress i18n sniff and invisible to `wp i18n make-pot` — so the

/**
 * The Zinn® panel: one dashboard widget, one settings-screen block, no remote calls.
 *
 * ⚖️ **Required by the owner, 2026-09-01:** *"each plugin should promote our hosting and
 * marketplace as well as Zinn Hub global marketplace inside people's site in the admin
 * dashboard … so it can be promoted properly inside people's wp dashboard"*, and *"as do all
 * our plugins for seo reach and understanding too as well as user guides for them … and
 * linked to in the plugins dashboard"*. Four things are named there — hosting, the
 * marketplace, Zinn Hub, and a user guide per plugin — and all four are here.
 *
 * ⭐ The pattern is `zinn-connector`'s dashboard widget (owner ruling 2026-08-22), which
 * promoted the same three destinations for one plugin. This generalises it to all of them and
 * adds the guide link, which is the half that makes the panel useful rather than only
 * promotional.
 *
 * ⛔⛔ **THIS IS OUR SURFACE INSIDE THEIR ADMIN, WHICH IS NOT OUR CONTENT ON THEIR SITE.**
 * `docs/203` §8: our brand stops at the publish boundary. A logged-in administrator looking at
 * wp-admin is looking at a plugin they installed from us, so our name belongs here. Anything
 * rendered on the public site would be a **footprint event before it is a branding one**
 * (§2.14) — the signature a footprint audit hunts for across a network. Every entry point
 * below is therefore an `admin_*` hook: no shortcode, no widget, no filter on `the_content`.
 *
 * ⛔ **No remote call, no tracking pixel, no image loaded from us.** A panel that fetched
 * anything would put a third-party request on the critical path of every admin page load on a
 * site we do not host — slow for them, and a liability for us the first time our API is down.
 * It is also what a WordPress.org reviewer looks for first.
